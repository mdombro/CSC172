LAB4 DESCRIPTION: Lab4 focused on implementing a simple LinkedList using generic programming. A LinkedList with methods insert, delete, contains, lookup, isEmpty, and printList was programmed. All testing of the methods in the main function was successful. The Lab folder itself contains a README.txt file with basic information, the Lab4.java program, and an OUTPUT.txt with basic output of the Lab4.java program.
